# C++ on Rails Web Framework by [IPROG TECH](https://iprog.tech)

C++ on Rails is a lightweight and efficient web framework inspired by Ruby on Rails and CodeIgniter, designed to simplify the development of web applications using C++.

## Disclaimer

C++ on Rails is not affiliated with or endorsed by the creators of Ruby on Rails. "Rails" is a registered trademark of Basecamp, LLC. The use of the term "on Rails" in the name of this project is intended to convey a structured and guided approach to web development, similar to that of Ruby on Rails.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `make` to build the executables. This automatically performs `make clean` before compiling.
3. `make` automatically cleans before compiling, but you can run `make clean` separately to just remove the compiled binaries.
4. Execute `./cpp-on-rails` for the default build or `./cpp-on-rails-prod` for a production build to start the sample server. The default build now opens your browser automatically, while the production build does not.

## Running tests

Run the test suite using `make`:

```bash
make test
```

## Templates

Pages now use a simple templating system. Layout files live in `app/templates`.
Each view sets the template path and the framework replaces tokens such as
`{{content}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{styles}}`, `{{footer}}` and `{{scripts}}` with
markup generated by the `Html` base class.

To create a custom layout for a client, add a new HTML file in
`app/templates` and point a view to it with:

```cpp
setTemplatePath("app/templates/client_layout.html");
```

This allows different pages or clients to share or override layouts easily.
